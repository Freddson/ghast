# ghast

Ghast is a configurable, command-line based tool built for streaming in a minimal environment.

# Requirements

The target system for ghast requires FFmpeg to be installed and accessible via ``$PATH`` in order for screen capture to function correctly.
You can do so by downloading FFmpeg from [the downloads page](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html "You can tip them too!") on their website, or (if you have a package manager such as ``apt`` on Debian/Ubuntu or ``brew`` on macOS installed) by installing it via your command line.
